# Python Learning Journey 🐍

This repository contains my Python practice codes and mini projects.
I created this repo to track my progress while learning Python fundamentals.

## Folder Structure
- basics → basic Python syntax and input/output
- conditionals → if-else and decision making examples
- data_structures → lists and tuples
- mini_projects → small practice projects

📌 All codes are written by me as part of my learning process.
